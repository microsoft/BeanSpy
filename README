1. Overview
BeanSpy is an open source technology provided by Microsoft for exposing JMX information from Java EE application servers through HTTP queries.  It currently supports the following Java EE application servers and web containers:
    Tomcat 5.5, 6, 7
    JBoss 4.2, 5.1, 6
    WebSphere 6.1, 7
    WebLogic 10gR3, 11gR1

The binary package contains 4 BeanSpy files digitally signed by Microsoft:
    BeanSpy.ear
    BeanSpy.war
    BeanSpy.HTTP.NoAuth.ear
    BeanSpy.HTTP.NoAuth.war

BeanSpy.ear and BeanSpy.war are used in cases where the Java EE application server or web container is using HTTPs transport with basic auth servlet authentication.  The HTTP.NoAuth version is used in HTTP transport without servlet authentication.  

The rest of this file describes how to use BeanSpy.  To build BeanSpy, please see the readme file included in the source package.

2. How to deploy BeanSpy
If your Java EE application server or web container is using HTTPs with basic auth, deploy BeanSpy.ear to JBoss/WebSphere/WebLogic; deploy BeanSpy.war to Tomcat. For Tomcat/JBoss/WebSphere, BeanSpy requires a user role "monitoring" for querying JVM and MBeans, and a user role "invoke" for invoking methods on MBeans, for WebLogic, BeanSpy requires "monitors" role for quering JVM and MBeans and "operators" role for invoking methods on MBeans. 

If your Java EE application server or web container is using HTTP without authentication, rename BeanSpy.HTTP.NoAuth.ear to BeanSpy.ear and deploy it to JBoss/WebSphere/WebLogic; rename BeanSpy.HTTP.NoAuth.war to BeanSpy.war and deploy it to Tomcat. 

3. How to query BeanSpy
Once BeanSpy is deployed, you can query it through the browser or invoke method on MBeans using HTTP POST. The following are a few examples.  For complete schema, please refer to the schema file in the source package. 
    a) To query JVM stats for memory, Garbage Collection, class loading, and threads, use:
       http://<host:port>/BeanSpy/Stats   
    b) To query configuration and version info about the Java EE application server or web container, use:
       http://<host:port>/BeanSpy/Stats/Info  
    c) To query specific MBeans, use:
       http://<host:port>/BeanSpy/MBeans?JMXQuery=<BeanObjectName>
       Here, BeanObjectName conforms to JMX standard, for example, com.contoso:Type=J2EEApplication,*
    d) To invoke a method on a MBean, use HTTP POST:
       http://<host:port>/BeanSpy/MBeans/Invoke 
       The HTTP post body should look like this: 
           <Invoke>
               <BeanObjectName>com.contoso:name=CustomMBeanName</BeanObjectName>
               <Method name="FooMethod">
                   <Param name="p0" type="java.lang.Integer">400</Param>
                   <Param name="p1" type="java.lang.String">bar</Param>
               </Method>
           </Invoke>
       Only primitive parameters are supported.  Composite data types are not supported. 

4. Additional parameters for BeanSpy queries 
There are a few parameters you can add to the URL to control the performance of your BeanSpy query.  
________________________________________
MaxDepth
Default maximum recursion depth when parsing MBeans 
Default value: 10

Modification: can be modified by adding parameters “MaxDepth” (case sensitive) in the URL. 
For example: “/MBeans?JMXQuery=com.microsoft.scx:jmxType=operationCall&MaxDepth=12”.
________________________________________
MaxCount
Default maximum number of properties to process when parsing MBeans 
Default value: 500

Modification: can be modified by adding parameters “MaxCount” (case sensitive) in the URL. 
For example: “/MBeans?JMXQuery=com.microsoft.scx:jmxType=operationCall&MaxCount=200”.
________________________________________
MaxSize
Default maximum size of the output XML when parsing MBeans. If the size of a XML file exceeds this value but does not exceed the absolute maximum XML file size (ABS_MAX_XML_SIZE), BeanSpy continues to proceed. However, it will reset the MaxDepth to the minimum which is 0. The same value is used as the default maximum size for the resultant XML when an Invoke POST call is processed. 
Default value: 2097152 (2MB)

Modification: can be modified by adding parameters “MaxSize” (case sensitive) in the URL. 
For example: “/MBeans?JMXQuery=com.microsoft.scx:jmxType=operationCall&MaxSize=20000”.
________________________________________
ABS_MAX_XML_SIZE
The absolute maximum size for the output. If the size of the output XML file exceeds this value, BeanSpy throws an exception and terminates. 
If the value is missing in the configuration file, use the default value which is 4M. 
Default value: 4184304 (4MB)

Modification: can be modified by the end user in resources.configuration.config file.
